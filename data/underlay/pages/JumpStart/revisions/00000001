== Change pages ==
You can edit a page by pressing the "edit" link. You find this at the top, in the sidebar area.

The pages of the wiki can either be edited in text mode or in GUI mode. 

 1. For the text mode, you need a few details about the markup language of the wiki (see HilfeZurMoinWikiSyntax or for more details: HelpOnEditing).
 1. The GUI mode is more intuitive and you can start right away ([[WikiCourse/30 The graphical editor]]).

== Add a new wiki page or attachment ==

Creating a new wiki page or attachment is performed in 3 steps:

 1. Add a link to the new page, either as a WikiName or with brackets `[[Name With Spaces]]`
 1. Save the page and click the new link
 1. Create and edit your new page and save it

=== Creating a link to an attachment ===

{{{
[[attachment:name_of_the_file.pdf]]
}}}
Result: [[attachment:name_of_the_file.pdf]]

Brackets `{{` are used to embed (transclude/include/show) some target (often an image, but can be text).

{{{
{{attachment:moinmoin.png}}
}}}
Result: {{attachment:moinmoin.png}}
